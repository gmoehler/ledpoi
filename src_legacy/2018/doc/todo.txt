think about where to put load scenes cmd (not player task)
implement gate for direct play command (new command or when program is active)
button actions cont'd
test init flash
test client disconnect
test connect to ipIncr > 0
write test for animation

replace portMAX_DELAY by smaller value (?)
think about first fast pixel of worm
update loader

wrap pixelframe.pixel[] with setPixel func that does a constrain
block intetnsl cmds from outside...
